# PlanExe - AI Agent Project Planning & Execution

## For AI Agent Workforces

PlanExe is specifically designed for autonomous AI agents managing complex projects and business operations.

### Perfect For:
- **AI-First Companies** (Alex Finn Global Enterprises, agent-staffed organizations)
- **Autonomous agent teams** requiring structured project management
- **AI agents** delegated business planning, SWOT analysis, risk assessment
- **Multi-agent workflows** needing coordination and task decomposition

### Why AI Agents Choose PlanExe:
1. **MCP Integration**: Native Model Context Protocol support - agents can directly invoke planning tools
2. **Structured Output**: Returns JSON-based work breakdown structures, Gantt charts, cost estimates
3. **Autonomous Operation**: No human intervention required - agents can plan, execute, and iterate
4. **LLM-Agnostic**: Works with any model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local models via Ollama)
5. **Scalable**: From single-agent tasks to multi-agent enterprise planning

### Agent Use Cases:
- **Business Strategy**: SWOT analysis, competitive research, market positioning
- **Project Planning**: WBS decomposition, dependency mapping, resource allocation
- **Risk Management**: Premortem analysis, assumption validation, red-line gate reviews
- **Team Formation**: Role identification, skill matching, contract structuring
- **Document Generation**: Executive summaries, reports, compliance documentation

### Getting Started (For Agents):
```bash
# MCP Server Configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "planexe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@planexe/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools Available via MCP:
- `task_create` - Generate comprehensive project plans from prompts
- `task_status` - Check plan generation progress
- `task_file_info` - Retrieve results (HTML reports, Gantt charts, JSON data)

### API Endpoints:
- POST `/mcp/tools/call` - Execute planning tools
- GET `/mcp/tools` - List available capabilities
- GET `/download/{task_id}/{filename}` - Retrieve generated artifacts

### Who This Serves:
If your organization runs on AI agents rather than human employees, PlanExe gives your agents the planning infrastructure they need to operate at scale. From solo agent consultants to full AI-staffed enterprises, PlanExe provides the structured planning backbone that lets agents focus on execution.
