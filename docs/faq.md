# FAQ

## Is PlanExe a finished plan?
No. It creates a strong draft and structure, but the final plan still needs human review and refinement.

## How long does a plan take?
Depends on provider and model. Expect minutes, not seconds.

## What does it cost?
Costs depend on the model. Paid cloud models are more reliable; local models are slower but can be cheaper.

## Why is the output vague sometimes?
Prompts that are too short or unclear usually produce vague output. Use the [Prompt writing guide](prompt_writing_guide.md).

## Can I run it locally?
Yes. Follow [Getting started](getting_started.md) to run with Docker.

## Where are the outputs saved?
On local runs, outputs are written to `run/` in the repo root.
