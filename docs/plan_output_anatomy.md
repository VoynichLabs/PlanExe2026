# Plan output anatomy

PlanExe produces a single HTML report. This page explains what each section is for and how to use it.

---

## Executive summary
- Use it to validate scope, deliverables, and assumptions.
- If this is wrong, the rest will be wrong too.

## Gantt chart
- A draft timeline with dependencies.
- Validate durations and sequencing with domain experts.

## Governance structure
- Roles, decision rights, and accountability.
- Useful for stakeholder alignment early.

## Risk register
- A first pass at risks and mitigations.
- Expect to add domain‑specific risks.

## SWOT analysis
- A strategic snapshot of strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats.
- Good for framing strategy, not for execution details.

## Next steps
- A prioritized list of actions to start implementation.
- Use it to build a real project backlog.
