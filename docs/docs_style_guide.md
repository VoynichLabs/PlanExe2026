## Tone and voice

- Be factual and specific.
- Avoid marketing terms like: quickstart, fastest.
- Avoid long personal stories in setup guides.
- Prefer short sentences.

## Structure
- Start with a 1–2 sentence summary.
- Use numbered steps for setup.
- End with “Next steps” or “Troubleshooting.”

## Terminology
- Use **plan** for the output.
- Use **report** for the HTML artifact.
- Use **MCP server** for the PlanExe MCP service.

## Code blocks
- Use fenced code blocks with language when possible.
- Keep commands copy‑paste friendly.
