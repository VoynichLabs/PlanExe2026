# Cross-Border Project Verification Framework (Bridge Example)

## Pitch
For cross-border infrastructure plans (e.g., bridge between Country A and B), provide a dedicated verification framework that coordinates jurisdictional, engineering, and geopolitical expert review.

## Problem
Cross-border projects have failure modes beyond engineering: bilateral regulation, environmental treaties, customs/logistics impacts, and political risk.

## Proposal
Create a cross-border verification pack with required domains:

- Structural/civil engineering

- Geotechnical and hydrology

- Environmental and permitting law (both countries)

- Public finance and procurement

- Geopolitical risk and bilateral governance

## Required outputs

1. Jurisdiction matrix (A vs B requirements)

2. Conflict map (where standards diverge)

3. Harmonization plan (how to resolve conflicts)

4. Independent risk verdict (go/no-go conditions)

## Expert orchestration model

- Two domestic expert leads (one per country)

- One independent neutral chair

- Domain specialists mapped to unresolved risks

## `run_plan_pipeline.py` support

- Detect cross-border project signatures

- Auto-generate jurisdiction-specific review packets

- Require dual-signoff before "verified" state

## Success metrics

- Number of jurisdiction conflicts resolved pre-procurement

- Reduction in late-stage legal blockers

- Stakeholder confidence score in cross-border readiness
