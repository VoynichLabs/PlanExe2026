# Verification Incentives, Governance, and Liability Model

## Pitch
Expert verification only scales if incentives and liability are clear. Add governance, compensation, and legal responsibility templates for trusted collaboration.

## Problem
Experts may avoid participation without clear compensation, scope boundaries, and liability protections.

## Proposal
Define a governance model with:

- Verification scopes (advisory vs certifying opinions)

- Compensation models (flat fee, milestone, retainer)

- Liability boundaries and insurance expectations

- Conflict-of-interest disclosures and recusal policy

## Verification contract templates

1. Expert engagement agreement

2. Review scope and deliverable definition

3. Evidence standard and acceptance criteria

4. Escalation + dispute resolution process

## Risk controls

- Mandatory disclosures for financial/political conflicts

- Multi-expert quorum for critical safety decisions

- Immutable audit trail of comments and signed decisions

## Product integration

- "Verified by" badges with confidence and scope labels

- Verification status visible to investors/stakeholders

- Exportable compliance bundle for due diligence

## Success metrics

- Expert participation and retention

- Legal disputes per 100 verified plans

- Investor trust uplift for verified plans
