# Governance, Risk, and Ethics for Autonomous Bidding Organizations

## Pitch
Define governance boundaries for an AI-run bidding organization so autonomous planning remains auditable, lawful, and aligned with stakeholder trust.

## Why
High-volume autonomous bidding can create legal, ethical, and market-manipulation risks without policy guardrails.

## Proposal
Establish a governance framework with:

1. Bid/no-bid policy rules

2. Human oversight thresholds for high-impact projects

3. Audit logs for all generated recommendations

4. Conflict-of-interest and collusion safeguards

5. Jurisdiction-aware compliance controls

## Policy examples

- Mandatory human signoff for projects above budget threshold

- No autonomous bids in restricted/sanctioned jurisdictions

- Mandatory disclosure bundle for generated assumptions

- Automatic refusal when source verification is weak

## Auditability requirements

- Immutable run record from intake -> ranking -> decision

- Explainability for why a bid was prioritized or rejected

- Reproducible artifact exports for regulators/partners

## Ethics controls

- Prevent exploitative targeting in fragile regions

- Avoid misinformation amplification from unverified news

- Include public-interest risk flags for critical infrastructure

## Success metrics

- Compliance incident rate

- Audit completeness score

- Stakeholder trust and acceptance of AI-generated bid decisions
