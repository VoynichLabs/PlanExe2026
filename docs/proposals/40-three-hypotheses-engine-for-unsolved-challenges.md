# Three-Hypotheses Engine for Unsolved Challenges

**Author:** PlanExe Team  
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Status:** Proposal  
**Audience:** R&D Leads, Innovation Managers

## Overview
The **Three-Hypotheses Engine** formalizes the "Discovery Phase" of a plan. When a team encounters an unsolved technical challenge (a "Known Unknown"), the system enforces a structured approach: generate exactly three viable hypotheses, design experiments to test them, and track progress until one succeeds or all fail.

It prevents "Tunnel Vision" (betting everything on one unproven idea) and "Analysis Paralysis" (endless research without action).

## Core Problem
Innovation is chaotic. Teams often pursue a single "pet theory" for months, only to fail. They rarely define *up front* what constitutes success or failure, leading to "Zombie Projects" that consume resources but produce no value.

## System Architecture

### 1. Challenge Definition
The user defines the *Problem Statement* (not the solution).
*   *Example:* "We need concrete that cures at -30°C."

### 2. Hypothesis Generator (H1, H2, H3)
The system (or user) proposes 3 distinct approaches. Each hypothesis is a "Bet".
*   **H1 (The Favorite):** High probability, moderate cost.
*   **H2 (The Backup):** Proven tech, higher cost/lower performance.
*   **H3 (The Moonshot):** Low probability, game-changing payoff.

### 3. Experiment Desiuge
For each hypothesis, defining the *Test Protocol*:
*   **Variable:** What are we changing?
*   **Metric:** What are we measuring?
*   **Success Criteria:** What number means "It works"?
*   **Kill Criteria:** What number means "Abandon ship"?

### 4. The Lifecycle Engine
A state machine that tracks each hypothesis through its stages: `Proposed` -> `Approved` -> `Testing` -> `Validated` OR `Refuted`.

## The "EVI" Formula (Expected Value of Information)

We prioritize experiments based on EVI.

$$EVI = (P_{success} \times Value_{success}) - Cost_{experiment}$$

Where:
-   $P_{success}$: Probability the hypothesis is true (Estimated).
-   $Value_{success}$: The Net Present Value (NPV) of the solution if it works.
-   $Cost_{experiment}$: The cost to run the test.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Calculate EVI for H1, H2, H3.
2.  If `EVI(H1) >> EVI(H2)`, run H1 first (Serial Strategy).
3.  If `EVI(H1) ≈ EVI(H2)`, run both (Parallel Strategy).

## Output Schema (JSON)

The structure of a Challenge object:

```json
{
  "challenge_id": "chal_777",
  "problem_statement": "Cold-weather concrete curing",
  "status": "active",
  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "id": "H1",
      "title": "Chemical Admixture",
      "p_success": 0.6,
      "cost_test": 5000,
      "value_success": 1000000,
      "evi": 595000,
      "state": "testing", 
      "experiments": [
        {
          "id": "exp_1",
          "metric": "cure_time_hours",
          "target": "< 24",
          "result": null
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "H2",
      "title": "Heated Formwork",
      "p_success": 0.9,
      "cost_test": 50000,
      "value_success": 800000, # Lower value due to higher operational cost
      "evi": 670000, 
      "state": "queued"
    }
  ],
  "strategy": "parallel" # Run H1 and H2 because both have high EVI
}
```

## User Interface: "The Experiment Dashboard"

A Kanban board with a twist. Columns are:
1.  **Hypotheses:** The 3 contenders.
2.  **In Flight:** Active experiments.
3.  **The Pivot Point:** Where decisions happen.
4.  **Graveyard:** Failed hypotheses (with "Post-Mortem" attached).
5.  **Winner's Circle:** The validated solution.

### The "Kill Switch"
If an experiment hits its "Kill Criteria" (e.g., "Cost > $100/unit"), the system automatically flags the hypothesis as `Refuted` and recommends moving resources to the next one.

## Future Enhancements
1.  **Automated Literature Review:** Agents that scan arXiv/Patents to suggest H1/H2/H3.
2.  **Bayesian Updating:** Automatically update $P_{success}$ based on partial experiment results.
