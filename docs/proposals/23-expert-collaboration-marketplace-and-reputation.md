# Expert Collaboration Marketplace + Reputation Graph

## Pitch
Create a trusted expert collaboration layer where plans can be reviewed by verified specialists, with transparent reputation and outcome tracking.

## Problem
Finding experts is not enough; users need confidence in reviewer quality, reliability, and relevance.

## Proposal
Add a marketplace-like module with:

- Verified expert profiles (credentials + domain tags)

- Reputation graph (quality of past reviews, response time, conflicts)

- Matching requests with SLA options

- Structured collaboration threads tied to plan sections

## Reputation dimensions

1. Technical accuracy of reviews

2. Resolution quality (did recommendations help?)

3. Timeliness and reliability

4. Conflict-of-interest transparency

## Anti-gaming controls

- Blind secondary reviews for high-stakes plans

- Anomaly detection for reciprocal rating abuse

- Weighted trust from verified outcomes (not just stars)

## User-facing value

- Better expert selection confidence

- Faster collaboration starts

- Persistent expert network for future plans

## Success metrics

- Median time-to-match expert

- Review completion rate

- User satisfaction with verification outcomes
