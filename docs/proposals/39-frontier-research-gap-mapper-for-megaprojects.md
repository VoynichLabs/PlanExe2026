# Frontier Research Gap Mapper for Mega-Projects

**Author:** PlanExe Team  
**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Status:** Proposal  
**Tags:** `research`, `frontier`, `megaprojects`, `feasibility`, `innovation`

## Pitch
Add a module that detects where a plan depends on unresolved science/engineering and explicitly maps those dependencies before bid commitments.

## Why
Some plans (e.g., Bering Strait bridge) require breakthroughs, not just execution discipline. Hidden research dependencies are major bid risk.

## Proposal
For each plan, classify components as:
- mature technology
- adaptation required
- unresolved frontier challenge

Generate a "research dependency register" with:
- challenge statement
- current state-of-practice
- missing capability threshold
- expected R&D timeline and cost uncertainty

## Example challenge classes (bridge in arctic context)
- ultra-cold concrete curing and durability
- ice-load resistant structural systems
- remote logistics and year-round constructability
- cross-border governance and standards harmonization

## Outputs
- Frontier Feasibility Index
- bidability penalty for unresolved research dependencies
- required pre-bid R&D package suggestions

## Success metrics
- Fewer bids on technically premature opportunities
- Better planning of R&D-first project phases
