# Autonomous Bid Factory Orchestration (1000 Plans/Day)

## Pitch
Design an orchestration layer that can generate, verify, and route up to 1000 bid-ready plans per day, while maintaining quality gates, auditability, and human oversight.

## Why
Generating plans at scale is only valuable if they are:

- high-quality and defensible
- properly verified
- routed to the right decision-makers
- consistent with governance and risk constraints

Without orchestration, a high-throughput system becomes noisy and untrustworthy.

## Problem

- Large volumes of opportunities require automated prioritization.
- Quality gates and verification can bottleneck throughput.
- Without routing logic, valuable bids get lost in a flood of noise.

## Proposed Solution
Build a bid factory orchestrator that:

1. Prioritizes incoming opportunities.
2. Dispatches plan creation jobs to a worker pool.
3. Applies staged verification and scoring.
4. Routes plans to investors or bid channels based on fit.
5. Logs all actions for audit and governance.

## Orchestration Architecture

```text
Opportunity Intake
  -> Prioritization Queue
  -> Plan Generation Workers
  -> Verification Pipeline
  -> Ranking and Escalation
  -> Routing and Dispatch
```

## Core Components

### 1) Prioritization Queue

- Assign priority based on urgency, bidability, and strategic fit.
- Enforce rate limits per domain to avoid overload.
- Allow human override for strategic opportunities.

### 2) Plan Generation Workers

- Run in parallel with concurrency limits.
- Use standardized prompt templates to reduce variance.
- Capture metadata and evidence used in plan generation.

### 3) Verification Pipeline

- Apply automated claim checks and evidence scoring.
- Route high-risk plans to expert verification.
- Produce confidence scores and missing-info lists.

### 4) Ranking and Escalation

- Rank plans by expected ROI and risk-adjusted confidence.
- Escalate top plans to human review.
- Auto-discard low-quality or non-viable plans.

### 5) Routing and Dispatch

- Route to relevant investor groups or bid channels.
- Trigger outreach or RFP response workflows.
- Track outcomes for feedback and learning.

## Output Schema

```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_123",
  "opportunity_id": "opp_987",
  "priority": "high",
  "verification_score": 0.78,
  "status": "escalated",
  "routing_target": "infrastructure_investors"
}
```

## Governance and Auditability

- Every plan has an audit log of inputs, prompts, and decision steps.
- Human review points are logged with rationale.
- Override decisions require justification.

## Success Metrics

- Plans/day throughput with quality acceptance rate.
- Percentage of plans passing verification.
- Time-to-dispatch from opportunity detection.
- Conversion rate to funded or awarded bids.

## Risks

- Throughput pressure lowering quality: mitigate with strict gates.
- Hallucinated data: mitigate with evidence checks.
- Routing errors: mitigate with feedback loops.

## Future Enhancements

- Adaptive prioritization based on historical win rates.
- Dynamic scaling of worker pools.
- Real-time dashboard of throughput, quality, and outcomes.

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase A — Queue Architecture and Throughput Controls (2 weeks)

1. Define four queue stages:
   - intake
   - generation
   - selection
   - packaging
2. Add quotas by domain/region and urgency tier.
3. Add backpressure and degrade-to-sketch mode under overload.

### Phase B — Worker Orchestration (2–3 weeks)

1. Build worker pools with stage-specific resource classes.
2. Add retry policies and dead-letter queues.
3. Add SLA timers by opportunity type.

### Phase C — Quality and Cost Governance (2 weeks)

1. Add quality gates before promotion between stages.
2. Add per-stage cost budgets and run caps.
3. Add escalation to deep-review only for shortlisted items.

### Phase D — Bid Package Assembly (2 weeks)

1. Generate standardized bid bundle artifacts.
2. Add package completeness checks.
3. Add handoff integrations for submission systems.

### Data model additions

- `bid_factory_runs`
- `bid_factory_queue_items`
- `bid_quality_gates`
- `bid_packages`

### Validation checklist

- Sustained plans/day throughput
- Cost per usable package
- Queue latency and starvation checks
- Package completeness pass rate
