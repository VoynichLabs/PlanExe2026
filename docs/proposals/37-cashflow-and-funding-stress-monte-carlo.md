# Cashflow + Funding Stress Monte Carlo (How Money Moves)

**Author:** PlanExe Team  
**Date:** 2026-02-10  
**Status:** Proposal  
**Tags:** `cashflow`, `finance`, `simulation`, `liquidity`, `risk`

## Pitch
Simulate weekly or monthly cash movement under uncertainty to identify liquidity cliffs, funding gaps, and insolvency windows before execution starts.

## Why
Projects fail from **cash timing issues** even when total budget looks sufficient. A stress simulation surfaces liquidity risk early and informs funding structure.

## Problem

- Budget totals do not capture timing risk.
- Payment delays and drawdown constraints are often ignored.
- Financing plans are rarely stress-tested.

## Proposed Solution
Build a Monte Carlo cashflow simulator that:

1. Models inflows and outflows over time.
2. Incorporates stochastic delays and default probabilities.
3. Runs thousands of scenarios to estimate liquidity risk.
4. Produces funding buffer recommendations.

## Cashflow Model

### Inflows

- milestone payments
- investor tranches
- grants
- debt drawdowns

### Outflows

- labor and contractors
- materials and equipment
- logistics
- compliance and legal
- contingency

### Risk Drivers

- counterparty payment delays
- procurement cost inflation
- FX volatility (for multi-currency plans)
- timeline slips affecting cash burn

## Simulation Workflow

1. Build baseline cashflow schedule.
2. Sample stochastic events (delays, cost spikes).
3. Compute cash balance over time.
4. Record insolvency windows and buffer needs.

## Output Schema

```json
{
  "probability_negative_cash": 0.27,
  "min_cash_buffer": 1800000,
  "worst_case_gap": 3200000,
  "time_to_insolvency_weeks": 14
}
```

## Policy Hooks

- Block plan escalation if liquidity failure probability exceeds threshold.
- Recommend tranche redesign or payment renegotiation.
- Adjust schedule to smooth peak burn periods.

## Integration Points

- Feeds into top-down and bottom-up finance modules.
- Informs investor risk scoring and funding structure.
- Links to risk propagation network.

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in mid-project funding crises.
- Better alignment between payment schedules and burn.
- Increased confidence in funding adequacy.

## Risks

- Over-reliance on assumed distributions.
- Underestimating black swan funding shocks.
- Poor quality input data yields false security.

## Future Enhancements

- Scenario-specific macro stress models.
- Automated FX hedging analysis.
- Live cashflow tracking during execution.
