## Payment and refund flows

### Buy credits (Stripe)
1. User opens **Account** and chooses credits.
2. Stripe Checkout is created.
3. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook.
4. App creates a `PaymentRecord` and a **CreditHistory** entry (+credits).

### Buy credits (Telegram Stars)
1. User opens **Account** and chooses credits.
2. App creates an invoice link via Telegram.
3. Telegram sends `successful_payment` webhook.
4. App creates a `PaymentRecord` and a **CreditHistory** entry (+credits).

### Spend credits (create a plan)
1. User submits a plan.
2. App deducts 1 credit.
3. A **CreditHistory** entry is created (delta = -1, reason = plan_created).

### Close account (user wants money back)
Typical approach:
- If credits are unused, issue a refund in Stripe/Telegram.
- Add a **CreditHistory** entry to remove credits (negative delta) or to zero the balance.
- Keep the ledger history intact (do not delete rows).

### Refund / correction
If something went wrong:
- Process the refund with the payment provider (Stripe/Telegram). **This is the only step that moves real money.**
- Add a **CreditHistory** entry that reverses the original credit grant. **This only changes internal credits.**
- Optionally update `PaymentRecord.status` (e.g., refunded).
