# Welcome!

PlanExe turns a single plain-English goal into a ~40-page [strategic plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning) in ~15 minutes using local or cloud LLMs. It’s an accelerator for first drafts — not a replacement for human refinement. PlanExe removes most of the labor for the planning scaffold; the final 10–30% that makes a plan credible and defensible remains human work.

**Try it first, then decide if you want to run it locally.**

## What you get

PlanExe generates a **single HTML report** (a self-contained artifact you can open in a browser). See the sample report here:
[Minecraft Escape sample report](https://planexe.org/20251016_minecraft_escape_report.html)

---

## 2-minute tour

Open the sample report and do this:

1. Read **Executive Summary** to see the top-level deliverables, budget, risks, and next steps.
2. Jump to **Gantt Interactive** to see how the goal gets broken down into many concrete tasks.
3. Open **Premortem** to see what could go wrong and what to do about it.
